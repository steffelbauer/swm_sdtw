# Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SDTW) Clustering
Source code and data from "Soft Dynamic Time Warping for Clustering Drinking Water Demand Patterns from Smart Water Meters" paper, developed in Steffelbauer et al. (under review)

This repository contains the code of the **Soft Dynamic Time Warping Clustering Approach** for user segmentation and high-level information extraction from  daily water demand patterns. The repository also contains the data used in Steffelbauer et al. (under review) to test the methods.

**Requirements:** 
- Python - The code in this repository has been developed and tested on Python 3.7.1

The following additional Python packages: 
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/).
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). 
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/).
- [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).
- [tslearn](https://tslearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).
